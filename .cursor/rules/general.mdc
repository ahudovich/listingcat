This are general coding rules for the project.

# ENUMS AND CONSTANTS

- Never use "magic strings" or "magic numbers" in the code.
- Always use typescript enums or vanilla javascript constants where appropriate.
- Declare them inside the file that uses them ONLY if they are used only in one place (this file).
- Extract typescript enums to separate files if they are used in multiple places (put them inside `enums` folder).
- Extract javascript constants to separate files if they are used in multiple places (put them inside `constants.ts` file).
- Name typescript enums with PascalCase.
- Name javascript constants with SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.

Examples:

```ts
// TS enum
enum Color {
  Red = 'red',
  Green = 'green',
  Blue = 'blue',
}

// JS constants
const MAX_ITEMS = 100
const COOKIE_PREFIX = 'prefix'
```
